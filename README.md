# JBU MTH-2231
This repo contains the programs that I write for my Discrete Mathematics Course at JBU.

# Project 1
- `check_satisfiability.py` is a program that determines the satisfiability of a user-input logical proposition with up to 3 variables (p, q, r) and operators (and, or, not). It validates the input, parses the operators, and checks for satisfiability with all variable assignments.
- `knights_and_knaves.py` is a skeleton of a program that solves "Knights and Knaves" logic puzzles. It is incomplete, and can only correctly solve one of the puzzles.
- `p_and_q_truth_table.py` creates a truth table for logical operations involving two variables (p and q), and prints the truth values for p, q, p and q, p or q, p xor q, p -> q, and p <-> q.

# Project 2
- `binary_search.py` takes an ordered list of n integers and determines the position of an integer using a binary search.
- `bubblesort.py` takes in a list of n integers and sorts them using the bubblesort algorithm.
- `first_and_last_largest.py` takes a list of n integerns and determines the first and last occurence of the largest element in the list.
- `greedy_cashier_algorithm.py` takes an integer number of cents and returns the corresponding denominations according to the greedy cashier's algorithm.

# Project 3
- `affine_cipher.py` includes functions to encrypt and decrypt a plain text message using the affine cipher.
- `bezout_coefficients.py` is a recursive implementation of the extended euclidean algorithm.
- `gcd.py` is a recursive implementation of the euclidean algorithm.
- `is_number_valid_in_row.py` is a function that checks the validity of a solution set for a row of a sudoku puzzle
- `rsa_encrypt.py` does what it sounds like it does.
- `rsa_decrypt.py` also does what it sounds like it does.
- `td_prime_factorization.py` uses the trial division algorithm to find the prime factors of a number. 

# Project 4
- `recursive_a^2^n.py` uses a recursive algorithm to compute a^2^n.
- `recursive_fibonacci.py` uses a recursive algorithm to find the nth term of the fibonacci sequence.
- `recursive_search.py` is a recursive binary search algorithm.
- Project 4 also requested a recursive gcd algorithm, but I already wrote that for project 3.

# Project 5
- `inclusion_exclusion.py` is a barebones implementation of the inclusion-exclusion principle.
- `no_consecutive_zeros.py` is a function that returns the number of binary strings of length n that do not contain consecutive zeros.
- `number7.py` implements a particular recurrence relation.
- `sudoku.py` is the complete sudoku solver.

# Tests
- `baseconversion.py` is an algorithm that converts a base 10 integer into a number of any integer base greater than 1.
- `isitprime.py` is a program that determines the primality of an integer using the sieve of Eratosthenes
