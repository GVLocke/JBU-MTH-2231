# JBU MTH-2231
This repo contains the programs that I write for my Discrete Mathematics Course at JBU.

# Project 1
- `check_satisfiability.py` is a program that determines the satisfiability of a user-input logical proposition with up to 3 variables (p, q, r) and operators (and, or, not). It validates the input, parses the operators, and checks for satisfiability with all variable assignments.
- `knights_and_knaves.py` is a skeleton of a program that solves "Knights and Knaves" logic puzzles. It is incomplete, and can only correctly solve one of the puzzles.
- `p_and_q_truth_table.py` creates a truth table for logical operations involving two variables (p and q), and prints the truth values for p, q, p and q, p or q, p xor q, p -> q, and p <-> q.

# Project 2
- `binary_search.py` takes an ordered list of n integers and determines the position of an integer using a binary search.
- `bubblesort.py` takes in a list of n integers and sorts them using the bubblesort algorithm.
- `first_and_last_largest.py` takes a list of n integerns and determines the first and last occurence of the largest element in the list.
- `greedy_cashier_algorithm.py` takes an integer number of cents and returns the corresponding denominations according to the greedy cashier's algorithm.
