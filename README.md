# JBU MTH-2231
This repo contains the programs that I write for my Discrete Mathematics Course at JBU.

# Check Satisfiability
`check_satisfiability.py` is a program that determines the satisfiability of a user-input logical proposition with up to 3 variables (p, q, r) and operators (and, or, not). It validates the input, parses the operators, and checks for satisfiability with all variable assignments.

# Knights and Knaves
`knights_and_knaves.py` is a skeleton of a program that solves "Knights and Knaves" logic puzzles. It is incomplete, and can only correctly solve one of the puzzles.

# P and Q Truth Table
`p_and_q_truth_table.py` creates a truth table for logical operations involving two variables (p and q), and prints the truth values for p, q, p and q, p or q, p xor q, p -> q, and p <-> q.
